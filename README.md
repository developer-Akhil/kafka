# Topic
A topic is a unique name for kafka stream.

Each topic has a name that is unique across the entire Kafka cluster.

You can have as many topics as you want.

A topic is identified by its name.

Like a table in database (without all the constraints)

The sequence of message is called a data stream.

You cannot query topics, instead, use kafka Producers to send data and kafka Consumers to read the data.
